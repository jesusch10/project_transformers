# Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) development:

This repository represents a comprehensive summary of my progressive learning path on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformers architectures based on next foundational resources:

- [**LLM Course** by Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/)
- [**Generative AI with Large Language Models Course** by AWS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms)
- [**Sequence Models Course** by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models), part of the **Deep Learning Specialization**
